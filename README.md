# year-in-pixels
<article>Hi, this is Valentina here. For my first hackatron I decided to build a year in pixel tracked.<br>
  If you are not familiar with it, it's a typical beginning spread for a bullet journalist to track their mood through the whole year.<br>
  I have made this so many times in my agendas, that this year I decided to bring it on the web.<br>
  I have a soft spot for vaporwave, so I tried to convey the vibe as well!<br>
  For this project I used html and css mainly, with the support of js.<br>
  Anyways I havent been coding for a long time so even finishing it, it's a huge step forward for me!<br>
  Now since it's 4 am i'll head to bed!<br>
  Happy coding! -Valentina Lynn (@amygdala_lynn on discord!)
