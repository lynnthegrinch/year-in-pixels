> A fun daily mood tracker for 2024!

Hi, this is Valentina here. For my first hackatron I decided to build a year in pixel tracked.

If you are not familiar with it, it's a typical beginning spread for a bullet journalist to track their mood through the whole year.
  
I have made this so many times in my agendas, that this year I decided to bring it on the web.
I have a soft spot for vaporwave, so I tried to convey the vibe as well!
For this project I used html and css mainly, with the support of js.
Anyways I havent been coding for a long time so even finishing it, it's a huge step forward for me!

Now since it's 4 am i'll head to bed!
  
Happy coding! - Valentina Lynn (@amygdala_lynn on discord!)
